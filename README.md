<h1><b>A Little Something About Nick McLaughlin</b></h1>

<h2><i>Basketball</i></h2>

<p>Basketball is something that was a birthright with a cousin of mine playing in the NBA.  What I learned in basketball are many different things that I have been able to translate to life whether it be working at your craft on your own in order to get better or helping a teammate out when they need it.

<a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a>
<p>Twitter is somewhere where I can get all my upto the minute news.  I have multiple screennames so at any time I can see what is going on in the world of news, video games, technology, finance, sports, etc.  Twitter has changed my life for better by allowing me to have instant access to the news I want.</p>   
<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Finance</a>
<p>The sub prime mortgage crisis made me be aware of the stock market at all times because of the impact it has on just about everything.  Shortly after the collapse I began to invest in companies that I thought were just going down because everything was going down. One of my first investments was Apple and its success led me to become interested in checking out the markets every now and then in order to look for new investments and keep track of my current ones.</p>
<a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/">538</a>
<p> Each day I like to read a blog or two on 538 in order to get a different perspective on things I enjoy such as sports. I like to see how Nate Silver's predictions turn out. The stastical analysis point of view is not one we hear often in the land of sports talk radio or even arguing with your friends so it is refreshing to get a different take on a topic being debated upon by many people.</P>
